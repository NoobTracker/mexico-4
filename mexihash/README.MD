# mexihash

A Rust re-implementation of the hashing algorithm used in the challenge. The original was written in mxc :D
Finds the input string that generates the correct hash, and checks for collisions.
Surprisingly, there are 0 collisions in the 24 bit space it was designed for. Also, there are 0 solutions for upper-case hex.

And yes, I know that you shouldn't roll your own crypto ...
